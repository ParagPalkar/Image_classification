A neural network is created to 
classify articles of clothing. To achieve this, a sub module of TensorFlow called keras is used.


# Input a number and the model will guess the image belongs to which class

Fashion MNIST is intended as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST datasetâ€”often used as the "Hello, World" of machine learning programs for computer vision

The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0, 1, 2, etc.) in a format identical to that of the articles of clothing you'll use here, this dataset includes 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for validation/testing.
